ca
=============
ca has provided with a ca.conf with good defaults.

1. First get rsa key for ca,

openssl genrsa -out private/ca-privatekey.txt 2048

2. Generate ca.crt (ca root certificate)

openssl req -x509 -new -key private/ca-privatekey.txt -out ca.crt -days 7300

3. Now we have ca.crt and can start signing csr. Let's assume csr in ../orgs/myorg/mydomain.csr

openssl ca -config ca.conf -in ../orgs/myorg/mydomain.csr

This will create a `serial`.pem in newcerts folder. Rename it to mydomain.crt and copy to your organization folder(orgs/myorg) to use.

domains
=============

1. First create rsa for domain,

openssl genrsa -out privatekey.txt 2048

2. Domains can create a csr and ask ca to sign. in orgs/myorg/csr-request.conf is such example
csr request config file. Fill it and use it. We need to generate a csr using this file by,

openssl req -new -config csr-request.conf -out mydomain.csr

Now run ca 3rd step.
